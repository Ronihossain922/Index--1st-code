    <h3>How online sales work?</h3>
    <p>Consumers open an account with the pharmacy and submit their credit and insurance information. The pharmacy is licensed to sell prescription medicines by the state in which it operates. It is also licensed and in those states to which it sells, if an out-of-state license is needed.</p>
<p>After creating an account, you must submit a valid prescription. Your healthcare provider can call it in. Or you can deliver send it to the pharmacy by fax or mail.</p>
<p>Some online pharmacies send products from a central spot. Others allow you to pick the prescription up at a local pharmacy. Prescriptions usually are delivered quickly, often with no shipping charge. For an extra fee, many sites will deliver overnight.</p>
<p>Sites typically have a way for you to ask questions of the pharmacist, either through email or a toll-free number.</p>
