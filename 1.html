    <h3>Why would you buy from an online Pharmacy?</h3>
<p>For some people, buying prescription medicines online offers advantages not available from a local pharmacy including:
</p>
<p>Greater availability of medicines for people confined to their homes, or for those who live far from the pharmacy.</p>
<p>The ease of being able to compare many sites to find the best prices and products.</p>
<p>Greater convenience and access to a wide variety of products.</p>
<p>Easier access to written product information, and references to sources other than what you would typically find in traditional storefront pharmacies.</p>
<p>The ability to order products and talk with a pharmacist in the privacy of your home.</p>
<p>Internet medicine shopping also claims to save consumers money. In some cases, this is true.</p>
<p>But consumers seeking health products online can find dozens of sites that the FDA says are legally questionable. Many of them specialize in providing medicines for erectile dysfunction, baldness, or weight loss. Others, based in foreign countries, promise to deliver prescription medicines at a much cheaper price than in the U.S. These medicines may be different from those approved in the U.S. Or they may be past their expiration dates. Still other sites make false health claims or advertise that you can buy medicines with no prescription.</p>
