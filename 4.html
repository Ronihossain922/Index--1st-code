<h3>What consumers can do?</h3>
<p>With hundreds of medicine-dispensing websites in business, how can you tell which sites are legitimate ones? The FDA offers these tips to consumers who buy health products online:</p>
<p>Check with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) to determine if the site is a licensed pharmacy in good standing.</p>
<p>Don't buy from sites that offer to prescribe a prescription medicine for the first time without a physical exam, sell a prescription medicine without a prescription, or sell medicines not approved by FDA.</p>
<p>Stay away from sites that don’t provide access to a registered pharmacist to answer questions.</p>
<p>Stay away from sites that don’t identify with whom you are dealing. Don’t provide a U.S. address and phone number to contact if there's a problem.</p>
<p>Beware of sites that advertise a new cure for a serious disorder or a quick cure-all for a wide range of health problems.</p>
<p>Be careful of sites that use impressive-sounding terms to cover up a lack of good science. Also, watch out for sites that claim the government, the medical profession, or research scientists are working together to block a product.</p>
<p>Don’t use sites that include 
    undocumented case histories claiming amazing results.</p>
<p>Talk with your healthcare professional before using any medicine for the first time.</p>
